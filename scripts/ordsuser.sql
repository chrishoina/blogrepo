I wish I could figure out a way to ONLY ask for username > check that against existing database users > AND THEN allow a user to continue with the 'choose password' step. I was only able to figure out how to ask for the username and password AND THEN checks against the database. I stole the code from this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30710990/creating-an-oracle-user-if-it-doesnt-already-exist 

Currently, its just extra steps for the user; kind of annoying. If you're reading this and can figure out a way to get this working, let me know! I'll make the change and attribute you in the comments :)
