The grade card shall be located in a conspicuous place where it may be readily observed by the public upon entering the food establishment. If the person in charge of the food establishment objects to the location designated by the regulatory authority then the person in charge may suggest an alternative location which meets the criteria of this Rule.\r\n(b) When an inspection of a food establishment is made, the regulatory authority shall remove the existing grade card, issue a new grade card, and post the new grade card in the same location where the grade card was previously posted as long as that location remains conspicuous. The person in charge of the food establishment shall keep the grade card posted at the designated location at all times. The grade card may be posted in another location which meets the criteria of this Rule if agreed upon by the person in charge and the regulatory authority.", "TYPE": "Inspection", "INSPECTOR": "Chris Askew", "PERMITID": 14112}}, {"attributes": {"OBJECTID": 52474192, "HSISID": "04092016590", "SCORE": 91.0, "DATE_": 1439251200000, "DESCRIPTION": "NOTE: Could not determine if a double check valve was on water supply line for soda machine ice machine in dining area.
